Top: Your first melee summon. Decent health, acceptable movement, inherent Shield 1 and Retaliate 1. A solid melee summon that can often take one or two hits before dying. Against lone enemies this can mean two or three turns of attacks, which is really good. The low attack 1 stat is poor though, and a strong modifier deck is needed to make this a viable attacker.
Bottom: Shield 1 for you and all summoned allies is potentially very useful, and infusing Earth can help support some other classes. However, the slow initiative means that this card must be paired with something fast if you want to actually get any benefit from the Shield.
Initiative: A very, very slow card. Useful if you want to summon the Iron Beast, otherwise not good. Pair with something very fast if you need the Shield effect.
Recommended Enhancements: None

Range Summons: 10
Melee Summons: 2
Archer: 9
Support: 6
Top: A great summon that has an insane range of 4, keeping well out of harms way. Attack 2 is good, but inflicting poison helps you and your teammates do extra damage. The downside is its low, low movement which will mean it gets left behind if summoned early in the scenario. Often you'll need to recover this card and re-summon it later in the scenario, or use cards granting move actions on it.
Bottom: Move 5 is always good. Infusing Air is great as it unlocks synergies with other cards later for very powerful effects. Remember though that as soon as you use the summon you lose the movement and Air infusion, unless you can recover the card.
Initiative: Very slow. Usual for this class but not really necessary for using this summon as you should be keeping it out of danger at all times.
Recommended Enhancements: +1 damage on the summon Attack stat, or Jump on the bottom are both solid, and keep this card viable even at level 9.

Range Summons: 2

Top: This card summons 2 (two!) allies which is easy to miss when first reading it. Double the allies, double the damage output, double the meat shields. The Shadow Wolves also have inherent Pierce 2 which is critical if your team has no other answer to Shielded monsters. They have high movement which lets you summon from further back, and can keep them out of danger while melee monsters move themselves into their range if you act slowly in a round.
Bottom: Disadvantage on monster's attacks can make the difference between your summons living and dying, and infusing Dark can help your teammates or unlock some very powerful bonuses to your attacks at higher levels.
Initiative: Slow, but actually quite quick for a summon card. Still too slow to use for the Bottom action unless paired with a faster leading card.
Recommended Enhancements: +1 Attack on the top can keep these viable for longer if you can afford it

Range Summons: 8

Top: An incredibly powerful summon that can sometimes tank multiple hits (more if you can heal it) while dishing out great damage and infusing Fire for you or your teammates to use. Has Retailiate 2 at Range 2 and applies Wound to anything it hits. Crazy! However, by playing this card for the Top action you lose access to the Bottom Action...
Bottom: ...which is often critical for the class to maintain enough longevity to avoid exhaustion. This is a signature action for this class and one you'll always bring. Recovering four lost cards is great and you should aim to play this as soon as you have 4 cards to recover, maximising the number of future turns. If the scenario looks short, or you feel you're doing well though, forget the Bottom and play that crazy summon for huge XP and fun.
Initiative: Very, very, very slow. No surprises.
Recommended Enhancements: None since the top is played so rarely that it's not worth the money.

Top: Heal actions are always good to have, and this allows you to either keep yourself healthy, or to support your melee teammates that take hits instead of your melee summons. The XP is a nice bonus.
Bottom: Forcing enemies to move is not consistently useful, but in scenarios with traps or where obstacles limit freedom of movement it can be a game changer. A shame it is only Move 1, but the high Range of 4 makes this a solid choice.
Initiative: At 31 this isn't super fast, but it quite fast indeed for this class. Against slower enemies this can let you and your summons act first in a round which is always good.
Recommended Enhancements: Strength and/or Bless on the top if you have teammates that you heal very often, or to Bless your own deck when used on tanky Summons that actually get benefit from being healed. Not a high priority though.

Top: The second of three signature cards for the class. An adjacent summoned ally (even those of your teammates) gets a free turn, in addition to its own turn before yours. Critically though, you decide where to move it and what to attack, instead of it following default AI rules. Pair with a faster card, or play when you have slow, slow enemies to ensure your summon gets multiple attacks off before risking counterattacks. Also gives you XP which is nice.
Bottom: Move 4 with Jump is always great.
Initiative: Middling speed is terrible considering the Top action requires you to go quickly and act before your enemies. Usually needs to be paired with something faster, or in situations where you can be sure the enemy will go slower than you.
Recommended Enhancements: None

Top: Final signature card. Identical Top action to Mighty Bond above.
Bottom: Loot 1 can be useful when you can't use the Top action for any reason. A Bottom action without a Move ability can limit your mobility in a scenario, but the Summoner has plenty of movement to make up for it.
Initiative: Slow, and slower than Mighty Bond. Again, pair with something faster if playing the Top action unless you're up against slow enemies.
Recommended Enhancements: N/A

Range Summons: 6
Melee Summons: 6
Archer: 8
Support: 7
Top: The first of the Summoner's decent arsenal of ranged attacks. Attack 2 is decent, but best when played the turn after Wild Animation's Bottom action to infuse Air. This then becomes Attack 3, Push 2 plus XP, often letting you shove enemies into traps for damage or stun effects. Solid card for lower levels in any sub-role.
Bottom: Another Heal, this time on the Bottom, allowing you to heal 6 HP in a single turn. Again, useful for supporting melee tank teammates in exchange for them keeping your melee summons safe, or for generally healing anyone who's damaged.
Initiative: 25 and our first actually quick card (for this class anyway!). Play this as the leading card after summoning something late last round, and pair it with a card that grants an action to your summons. Watch the fun unfold. Bonus points if you can play the top with Air infused to attack a monster and push them out of melee range to prevent a hit on your summon.
Recommended Enhancements: +1 attack, or immobilise on the Top if you can push often, keeping melee enemies away from your summons.

Top: A solid multi-target attack with huge range and situational Wound for all targets. The great initiative means you will bring this card often, so it's a strong candidate for enhancement if you have enough gold to afford the high price.
Bottom: Move 3 that muddles adjacent enemies is decent, and in a pinch can help you save teammates, summons and yourself from a bit of damage when you're forced to get in melee range.
Initiative: 24 is the fastest card you have at Level 1. For this reason you will find yourself bringing it to battle for a good while, at least until you get access to faster cards. Like Biting Wind above, play after a late summon to try and outpace mid-speed enemies.
Recommended Enhancements: Top action is expensive due to the doubled cost for multi-target attacks. However, if you can afford it, adding an extra target is great, or adding poison helps your summons and teammates do extra damage.

Range Summons: 2

Top: Another melee summon, this time one that flies. Attack 2 that infuses Air is good and can help you unlock added effects of some Top attack actions on other cards. This summon being able to fly is a mixed blessing - it'll be easier for it to move into an attacking position, but conversely it'll make it easier for it to rush into a position to be killed, or away from you when you need it to be adjacent to grant it an attack action.
Bottom: Strengthen is a decent support action, but this is a bottom action and lacks movement, meaning you either need to be already adjacent to your teammates or summons, or you need to summon them into position and use this card immediately.
Initiative: Slow. Just slow.
Recommended Enhancements: None

Top: An extremely fragile melee summon that can be made to attack once or twice before its inevitable death. On dying it can perform a huge attack on a large group of enemies and infuse Fire, letting you follow up with Black Fire next round for deathblows and extra Wounds for tankier enemies. An interesting concept for a summon, and one that could be great at higher player counts or in scenarios with many low health enemies.
Bottom: The first Bottom action with a ranged attack, making it a great partner to any Top attack action for maximum damage in a single turn. Infuses Fire to synergise with other cards next round.
Initiative: Slow, which is not ideal when played for the Bottom action. Pair with something faster in most cases.
Recommended Enhancements: +1 or poison on the Bottom action are both good, with poison preferred at higher difficulty where enemies are tankier and more of your teammates can benefit from the added damage.

Range Summons: 4
Melee Summons: 0
Archer: 7
Support: 8
Top: This is technically an attack, but is actually stronger as a support option that allows you to immobilise melee enemies while they're out of range of you and your ranged teammates and summons.
Bottom: Move 2 offers nothing over any other card, and the Heal 1 on summons is situational at best. It's rare that summons benefit from being healed, unless you're working with high health or shielded creatures.
Initiative: 30 is fast for this class and is a solid option if your faster cards have already been played this round.
Recommended Enhancements: None

Top: The Top half of this card is......hard to work with, both in game and in writing this guide. A loss card that situationally gives you or a summmon +2 movement is not a great tradeoff. Not much else to say about this.
Bottom: Move 5 with Jump, on the other hand, is just plain good. You'll never regret bringing this action along.
Initiative: The initiative is what makes this card outstanding though. 13 is fast by any measure and can almost guarantee that you can go before enemies, netting your summons a free turn immediately after being summoned. You can use the Move 5 Jump to good effect, or even a default Attack 2 melee if the opportunity arises. This is the fastest card the Summoner has access to.
Recommended Enhancements: None. Move 5 is enough!

Top: Another range attack for you arsenal, this time with added Curse which is always welcome. Additionally, if you can reliably infuse Dark you can add Stun. Stun is good. Really good. In a pinch this can keep your summons alive by stunning something that would otherwise kill them.
Bottom: Another attack, this time with heal instead of Curse. The flexibility this card brings (when Dark is not available) is great, and most importantly it's another Bottom attack action, letting you pair it with a Top attack for high damage output, plus a mini heal for you.
Initiative: Pretty bad at 62. Better than your summon cards at least.
Recommended Enhancements: None

Top: A loss action that can potentially kill multiple normal enemies. Useful for hordes of low health enemies, or softened up Shielded enemies to get easier kills. This action can work in most sub-roles, but is situational.
Bottom: Heal 4 is great, but it only works on you. This is not necessarily a bad thing, but this is less useful if you have melee or tank teammates.
Initiative: 41 is nothing special, but faster than average for the Summoner.

Top: A new melee Summon that can replace one of the Level 1 specimens, perhaps filling the same role as Forged Ferocity. The Slime Spirit has Shield 2 and 4 health which can allow it to survive one or even two hits at lower difficulty levels. It has poor attack but does Muddle its target which can increase its survival chances against a lone enemy dramatically.
Bottom: A fantastic bottom attack action, allowing the Archer sub-role to access more single-turn double-attack options. This one immobilises which is usually always useful, and can curse if Dark is infused. Dark is almost always better spent on the Stun of Grasping the Void though, if you take that card and it's in your hand.
Initiative: It's a summon card so the initiative is pretty bad, unless you're Summoning something.
Recommended Enhancements: +1 on any of the summons attack or HP, or the bottom attack can make this card viable for longer.

Top: A tanky melee summon that you can actually play every scenario. 7HP with 3 Attack is good, and if worked hard this summon can do some real damage before taking a final dying hit for you. Then you can recover the card and do it all over again in the next room. This summon can be healed if needed, but will not take multiple hits in a single turn well even with 7 health.
Bottom: Move and Loot actions are always good. A simple action but a good one, giving you reliable income when you're not playing this card for its summon.
Initiative: It's a summon card. It's slow. You get that by now, right?
Recommended Enhancements: None

Top: This card is a must have for any summon sub-role. The Top action lets you position all your nearby Summons or let them keep up while you advance to a new room. Again, you control the movement so can deviate from AI rules. Bonus XP is again always welcome.
Bottom: This is where the card really shines. Play this card with a faster partner, or one that also grants another summon action on its Top half, playing them both the turn after a late summon and you have a machine made for killing monsters. If you can find ways to summon multiple allies then this card grants all the nearby ones an attack on targets that you choose. Amazing.
Initiative: Bad initiative is the major downside of this card. 55 will lose to many enemy action cards, so you'll need a faster leading card or a way to ensure you'll win the speed game to make the most of this card.

Top: This Top action is great for any kind of summon. Boosted move and boosted attack with some XP for you is always welcome. The +1 move and +1 attack work best on summons with low movement and low attack (of course), making their low stats more viable, and the least dangerous summons twice as deadly when you turn their Attack 1 into Attack 2. Again, remember that you decide how the move is used and who to target with the attack.
Bottom: The Bottom of this card can help the Archer build, but does rely on your team having at least 3 summons out when played to keep it viable. Bear in mind that the summons of your teammates also count, so in a 4 player game with other classes that have summons, this can be a viable, and very occasionally brokenly overpowered, choice. Eight summons on the board? Attack 8, Range 8? Yes please.
Initiative: Not great at 45, again demanding ways to win the initiative battle or pairing with a faster leading card for the top action at least.
Recommended Enhancements: N/A

Top: A new ranged summon with a decent range of 3, but poor attack of only 1. The best part of this summon is obviously its Heal 2 inherent ability, but the limited range for this heal of only 2 hexes can stop it healing when you really need it. Controlling its movement yourself through granting it move actions can help overcome this problem.
Bottom: Move 5 is again always welcome. Simple and sweet.
Initiative: It's another summon card. Need I say more...? Yes? OK, it's slow at 88.
Recommended Enhancements: Jump on the Move action is good if you lack Jump on other cards you bring at this point, but the price is high due to the level of this card.

Top: This card is a big bag of contradictions. It puts out 3 (three!) summons for one loss action, but they don't attack. They have Shield 1 and Retaliate 2, but with only 4HP they'll likely die in one hit, preventing the Retaliate from activating. The Bottom of this card would work well with these summons, but you can't ever use it on them. Weird card. If you can support these summons with a fast Shield 1 from Forged Ferocity, or a fast Disadvantage for enemies using Living Night, you can get some utility out of them. They also boost the Bottom attack of Strength in Numbers by Attack +3 and Range +3, which is nice.
Bottom: Retaliate 2 for all your summons sounds good, but needs a lot to make it work. The summon needs to survive a hit for Retaliate to trigger, and this action needs to be paired with a fast card to make sure it gets played before enemies have their turn. Hard to make it work.
Initiative: 97 is almost as slow as you can go, which is great for summoning the Nail Spheres, but terrible for almost anything else.
Recommended Enhancements: Increasing the summons' health to 5 may make them more viable with less support but isn't cheap.

Top: This card has a great Top action. A solid ranged Attack 3 with inherent Pierce 3 makes short work of shielded enemies, which up until this point may have been problematic. Combine this with an Air infusion though and it becomes one of your strongest cards. Attack 5, Range 3, Pierce 3 with a reliable means of setting up Air is a must have for the Archer sub-role.
Bottom: Move 3 and the possibility to then grant a Move 3 to a summon is good, and sometimes great. Note that this move for your summon is not one you control, so it will use the automated movement rules. It will not move if no enemies are on the board.
Initiative: 32 is pretty quick for this class, another good reason to take this card for all sub-roles.
Recommended Enhancements: Anything on the Top Attack action is great, from a +1 to a Disarm or Immobilise, but as a level 6 card the cost is pretty high.

Top: A new ranged summon, and it's a really, really good one. It has good movement so can keep up, Attack 2 which is acceptable even when unboosted, and 5HP so can survive a weak hit if things go wrong. It's Range 2 stat is poor though and puts it close to the danger of front line attacks, requiring you or your teammates to stay between it and the enemy or risk losing it. It's real strength though is the fact that its attacks Curse. This is always a good thing, requiring only that the enemy survives the attack, and with Attack 2 that's usually the case. Curses in the enemy deck means everyone on your team lives longer on average. This is good news. Put this girl out early, give her as many attack actions as you can and enjoy the wonderful results.
Bottom: Oh, this card has a bottom action. Of course. Curse anything threatening your summons and infuse Dark. Sure, I can see how this would be useful sometimes, but honestly you're just better off getting the summon out and working it as hard as you can.
Initiative: 95, but you weren't playing this for the initiative...
Recommended Enhancements: +1 on the summon's range is a strong contender, but costs an enormous amount of money.

Top: An Attack 5 with Muddle is a welcome addition to the class, except that this attack is melee. Using Fire boosts it to Attack 6 and adds Wound, which to be fair can make this a viable card to get a kill while you shield your ranged summons from melee enemies. By this point though you've likely become used to avoiding melee range as much as possible, making this card look worse than it actually is.
Bottom: Move 3 with a Strengthen for your teammates and summons is good, coupled with an initiative that make this a viable tactic. Simple and effective.
Initiative: 27 is very fast for this class and, even with the average actions, this can make it worth taking to support summon roles and early actions for your summoned allies.
Recommended Enhancements: Boosting the Top attack is plausible, but expensive to say the least.

Top: A loss card that can keep your summons alive, for a few more hits at least. I wrote this card off as bad initially, but can now see some strong plays using it. Firstly, your summons negating three hits can mean you avoid three killing blows, saving you from losing cards. This can also net a key summon additional turns to act. Against a lone Boss your tanky Golem suddenly soaks up hits, hits back hard and keeps you out of danger. Still, it's hard to make this work and to justify not only a card slot, but a loss card to boot. Play it late in the scenario if you choose it.
Bottom: Removing curses sounds good, and if you have lots of summons getting hit with curse attacks (and surviving the blow to suffer the curse) then you may find a lot of them in your modifier deck. In practice though this is rare and was never, ever a problem in the many scenarios I played. It also infuses Light which might help a teammate. I guess...
Initiative: 68 which is mediocre. If this card had sub-10 speed it would actually be a very solid candidate to take over others.
Recommended Enhancements: None

Top: Any summoned ally within range 3 can have a free attack with a heavily boosted output of +2 damage, Wound and Poison. You even get to pick their target yourself. Simply amazing and a strong candidate to pull back with a Stamina potion if your summon is ranged, or manages to survive any counterattacks. Insanely, this even gives you XP! Poison can help your teammates do more damage, as well as any other summons you have.
Bottom: Optionally swap positions with any summon, at any range, through walls or doors. Then Move 3 whether you swapped or not. In a few scenarios this can be a game winner.
Initiative: 35 is fairly good for this class, but at this point you should have enough fast cards to use with your summons and action granting cards.
Recommended Enhancements: None (too expensive)

Top: A solid card for any role, it allows you to either extend your maximum number of turns beyond even the largest hand-size classes, or to summon your MVP up to three times per battle. Option 2 is not to be underestimated - a strong summon (or group!) that just keeps coming back to life is terrifying to behold.
Bottom: Move 6 Jump is just great whatever the scenario is and no matter how its going.

Top: High move, high damage, inherent pierce - what a summon! Work it hard with your (by now) amazing melee summon skills and watch it rip your enemies to pieces. Also it's a Unicorn. Unicorns are bad ass.
Bottom: Every single summon in range 3 gets an attack on whatever targets you choose. Summon a horde, pray they arrange themselves in effective positions and then unleash hell. Game changing on the occasions when it works properly. Still decent when things don't go perfectly.
Initiative: 80 is fine for the summon, but terrible for the bottom action. Pair with something really fast to avoid wasting its full potential.
Recommended Enhancements: None. The cost is just ridiculous.
